Project Prompt from IBM course
"Your client has asked you to build a website for a famous band. The backend developer on the project has recently left, and you need to finish the code so the website can go live. The application consists of some different microservices working together.

You are asked in this lab to finish the Get Pictures microservice. This microservice stores URLs of pictures from past events. The previous developer started a Python Flask-based REST API and wrote some tests following the TDD or test driven development process. You will need to get the code from GitHub and fill in the missing pieces so that the code can pass all tests."
